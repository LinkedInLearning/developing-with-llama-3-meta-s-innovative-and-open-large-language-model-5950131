In this course we take a look at Llama 3, Meta's innovative and open large language model (LLM). You'll learn the advantages that Llama 3 offers over other LLMs and how its open source license is different from other traditional licenses. We'll look at how well the model works through Meta's official Meta.ai platforms and how developers can access and use the API in order to integrate Llama 3 into their AI development projects.
